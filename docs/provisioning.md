# User Provisioning & Permissions

Single sign-on functionality is currently limited to authentication. User provisioning is handled via a CSV upload facility in-app -- details on this are available in the [HOW2 Learning Centre](https://teachinghow2s.com/learn/course/tools/colleagues/bulk-importing-users).

This means that in the vast majority of cases it will be best to grant all staff users access to the TeachingHOW2s app. Any SSO attempts from users that have not already been invited to the HOW2s will be handled gracefully, so there is no benefit to be gained from managing access manually.

Given the intended use of the app it is highly unlikely that any organisations will want to grant students access.
